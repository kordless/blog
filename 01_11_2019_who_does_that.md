# Who Does That?

I rode my scooter up to Starbucks to write this morning. I've decided to move my writing to Github, given writing words and code is basically the same process to me. Thinking mind.
When I sat down, I overheard a coversation between two girls. One girl said to the other, "Listen to how stupid my coach is. She put that inexperienced girl in instead of me on that play. Who does that?" 

I tried to tune out the remaining borish details of why this teacher of youth in an expensive place was stupid, stupid, stupid. 

Moments later writing about it I realize I too had judged the girl to be a negative person. I judged her friend too. Moments later she was also being called stupid. "Don't be stupid!" 

From what I understand about communciations, "Who does that?" and "Don't be stupid!" are nearly identical statements, and are probably better asked of ourselves.

"Why did you do that?" would be what I would say to myself. Why are you failing to understand the scope of the problem? (A version of "stupid", applied to myself). Why did you react that way? Why did you judge that individual, even when they did nothing obvious? 

The simple answer is, we're human. Humans make mistakes. Daily. Each of us. These mistakes frequently take the form of judgements of others.

Moreover, it's super easy to practice judgment. Far easier than to judge ourselves. 

These judgements closely match the judgements we have of ourselves, typically. Our internal judgements, when ignored about ourselves, tend to turn into judgments of others.

The opposite of that is love, as in romatic love. Love is a suspension of a *set of judgments* we hold aginst others. 

The daughter running away with a bad boy is a father's worst fear.  

When love goes wrong, those judgements can come back with intent.

Being mean is a form of judgment with intent. When one is mean to another, they intend harm through a judgement in which there lies intent. This intent can include deciet.

When the girl said to the other, "Listen to how stupid my coach is", what was actually meant was, "Here. Take this judgment and apply it to this teacher for me." 

By assigning the judgment to another, the first girl was able to disconnect her own judgment from it. She was able to "hide" the judgment internally, by having it "validated" by another person.

A loose analagy would be the INVERSE of LOVE. Hate.

Hate is a mistake.

Love is the answer.

Buddhist thought indicates love is the logical conclusion to life. To love everyone equally, with suspended judgment. This is, of course, a trap. Zen teachers excel at these types and call them koans.

The trap comes by the way that judgement can never be completely eliminated. It will always exist because we are not perfect. If we chose to live, we must choose to live forgiving ourselves. If we manage to do that, we will supsend our self judgment. If self judgment is suspended, we tend to not have a lot of judgment for others, which is basically loving them for who they are. 

On the other hand, if one were to complain about a grivance one had of another to that person directly and then say "Who does that?" what is actually meant is "I am not interested in removing my judgment on this particular matter. I wish others to adopt my judgment and if they do not, I will continue to seek others who share my judgment in this regard."

It's a lot to unpack, from a little sentence, but it's all there. The question leads the conversation with the hypothetical/irrational statment that NOBODY else but this one person would be guilty of this"grievance". That the person committed a grievance that nobody else would do makes them the worst possible person, which is just a way of clearly labeling a target.

And, if one finds themselves to be labled the worst human, it stand to reason they must be stupid.

It's better to be aware of these types of questions and then refuse to interact with them. If a relationship is involved, it's probably best to find a way for the questions to never form.

Questions like this can't form if you don't hang around people who continue asking them!
